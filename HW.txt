Please, write a bash script to answer these question
Run the trinity assembly as in:
https://github.com/drtamermansour/nu-ngs01/blob/master/Day-4/trinity.md

1) how many assembly clusters do we have in the assembled transcriptome?
2) Report the assembled gene(s) with the highest number of isoforms
3) visualize the shortest and longest isoforms in IGV. share a screen image for each
4) Re-run your version of the code in ~/workdir/trinity2 and treat the RNA-seq library as a non-strand specific library
run TrinityStats.pl on both assemblies then merge the output files in one table that has a column for the features of the assembly and a column for each assembly stats. Do not worry about the titles of the sections. The aim here is to put the stats of both assemblies side by side to compare.
Here is an example line
Total trinity 'genes' 1234  5678
